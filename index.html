                <p class="question">What is CTF in terms of cybersecurity ?</p>
                <p class="answer">Capture the Flag (CTF) in computer security is an exercise in which "flags" are
                    secretly hidden in purposefully vulnerable programs or websites. Don't worry here you don't need to
                    hack any application these CTFs are very easy and made to give you a glimpse of actual CTF. These
                    Labs are made focusing on the knowledge of our participants.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Types of CTF:</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>Attack & Defense CTF / Red-Team-Blue_team</li>

                <p class="question">How to play ?</p>
                <p class="answer">You are given 5 Labs to solve. Hints are available in every lab, read properly
                    whatever hints are given. Difficulty will increase as you go on solving labs. Google along with
                    other online sites will help you to capture the flag. your googling skills matter during the
                    competition. The first two labs will be easy and you will be guided in these 2 labs but next 3 labs
                    you have to do yourself with hints available or with your thinking capabilities.</p>
